## Problem: Task Management Application
Requirements
We need to build a simple Authentication Management App with the following features:

User Authentication
Users should be able to register and log in.
Use JWT for authentication.

Authentication Management
Authenticated users can **create**, **update**, **delete**, and **view tasks**.
Each task should have a title, description, due date, and status (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Done").

Usage
Responsive Design
Use React with Tailwind CSS to ensure the application is responsive and looks good on different screen sizes.

Back-End (Node.js with TypeScript)

Setup
Initialize a new Node.js project with TypeScript.
Set up an Express server.

Authentication
Create user registration and login endpoints.
Use bcrypt to hash passwords.
Implement JWT for secure authentication.
Task Management API


Use a database (e.g., MongoDB ) to store user and task data.
Front-End (React with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS)
Setup

Initialize a new React project with TypeScript.
Configure Tailwind CSS for styling.

Authentication
Create components for user registration and login.
Manage authentication state (e.g., storing the JWT in local storage).

Authentication Management UI
Create components to list tasks, add new tasks, edit tasks, and delete tasks.
Use React Query or a similar library for data fetching and state management.

Styling
Use Tailwind CSS to style the application and make it responsive.
